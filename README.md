# Pokémon Trainer Hub  
Pokémon Trainer Hub is a web application designed to help users compare the stats of different Pokémon. Users can drag and drop Pokémon into designated drop zones, and the application will display a detailed comparison of their base stats. This tool could also work well for a digital Pokédex to keepo track of your Pokémon in Pokémon Go, as well as to analyze and strategize based on Pokémon strengths and weaknesses for battling gyms.

## Features  
### Drag and Drop Interface
Users can drag a Pokémon from a list and drop it into a disignated comparison box to begin the stat comparison.
### Real-time Pokémon Data
This app fetches data directly from the Pokédex API.
### Dynamic Stat Bars
Visualizes Pokémon stats with dynamically generated stat bars, making it easy to visually compare, even with the smallest differences.
